# Per-module emit as the default build path

## Context

Blink's compiler can emit a program in two shapes:

1. **Monolith** — one fat `.c` for the whole program (entry + every
   reachable module), compiled and linked in a single `cc` invocation.
   This is what `blink build` / `blink run` have always done, and what
   `--emit c` writes to disk.
2. **Per-module** — one `.c` and one `.h` per program module, plus an
   aggregator header (`_blink_all.h`) that every TU includes so
   cross-module calls and typedefs resolve. Each module `.c` is compiled
   to its own `.o` and linked. See `generic-mono-ownership-per-module.md`
   and `per-module-o-cache.md` for the front-end split and the `.o`
   cache that elides unchanged recompiles.

The per-module machinery is mature: the four invariants in
`task ci-per-module-checks` (monolith-vs-per-module byte-equality,
cli.bl self-host, determinism, gen1/gen2 byte-equality) have held green
through the `tc83pp` project. Until now it was only reachable through the
**hidden** `__emit-per-module` subcommand — undocumented, unstable, and
not surfaced in `blink build --help` or `blink llms`.

This decision (br `fc9nrd`) promotes per-module emit to a documented flag
and charts the path to making it the default build path.

This is a build-orchestrator decision — **BDFL, no `/deliberate` panel**
(it changes how we build, not the Blink language surface).

## Decision

### 1. Documented flag

Per-module emit is now reachable as:

```
blink build --emit per-module-dir <file.bl> <outdir>
# or, output dir via -o:
blink build --emit per-module-dir <file.bl> -o <outdir>
```

It writes the per-module `.c`/`.h` set (plus `_blink_all.h`) into
`<outdir>`. The output target is a **directory**, not the single-file
path that `--emit c` and the default binary build assume — this is the
one structural difference in the `cmd_build` flow.

### 2. One-release deprecation alias

The hidden `__emit-per-module <file.bl> <outdir>` subcommand stays wired
as an **alias** for one release so existing callers (Taskfile,
out-of-tree scripts) keep working. It dispatches to the same
`cmd_emit_per_module`. It will be removed a release after the flag ships.

### 3. Monolith stays reachable for bisecting

`--emit c` continues to emit the single monolith `.c`. This is the
fallback for bisecting a codegen regression: if per-module output
misbehaves, compare against the monolith `.c` for the same program. The
**stdlib archive** (`libblink_std.a` / `monolith.o`) also stays a
monolith — the archive is a separate, pre-built artifact and is not
affected by the per-module *program* emit path.

### 4. CI gate restructure

- `task ci` is the canonical gate. It runs **`ci-monolith`** (full
  monolith verification: regen bootstrap + all tests + fmt + installed
  smoke + cross-compile smoke) **and** **`ci-per-module-checks`** (the
  four per-module invariants). So `task ci` covers all four invariants
  by construction.
- `task ci-monolith` is the legacy monolith-only verification, kept green
  as a standalone fallback so a codegen regression can be bisected
  against single-TU output.
- `task ci-per-module-checks` holds the four per-module invariants
  (renamed from the old `ci-per-module`). `ci-profile` times this phase.

## Path to default

The eventual flip makes the per-module path the default for
`blink build` / `blink run` (link-only fast path on warm `.o` cache),
with monolith reachable via an explicit flag. The wins:

- **cc warm-cache.** Per-module `.o` caching (`per-module-o-cache.md`)
  means an incremental build recompiles only the changed module's `.c`
  and re-links. The monolith path recompiles the whole program every
  time.
- **link-only fast path.** When nothing changed, the build is a pure
  link of cached `.o` files — no `cc -c` at all.
- **archive monolith stays for stdlib.** The stdlib is already a
  pre-built archive; per-module program emit composes with it unchanged.

The blockers before flipping the *default* (tracked separately): the
default-build link orchestration must drive the per-module `.o` cache and
link step end-to-end (today `cmd_emit_per_module` only writes the `.c`/`.h`
set; the caller drives `cc`). Until then, per-module is opt-in via the
flag and exercised by `task ci`, while the default `blink build` stays on
the monolith path.
